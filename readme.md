# 🚀 SkapRichPresence

**SkapRichPresence** is a standalone, configurable **Discord Rich Presence** system for FiveM.  
It allows your server (and even other scripts) to dynamically update the player’s Discord status — showing what they’re doing, where they are, or which job they have — through exports.

## 🌟 Features

- Fully **configurable** via `config.lua`
- Dynamically update status using **exports**

- Optional **auto-updating** Rich Presence (job, player count, location)
- Custom **Discord assets** (large/small icons & text)
- Supports **QBCore job integration**
- Super lightweight and optimized
